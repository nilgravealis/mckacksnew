# SUS: Symptom Understanding System
## Inspiration
We identified the problem of communication barriers between doctors and patients in healthcare. We decided to do our part to worsen the problem, and provide some short-term amusement for long-term misery.
## What it does

**Symptom Tracking:**

Click which symptoms you are experiencing on a given day, and the tracker will put them into a helpful table view, designed so that you can see trends in colour over time! Unfortunately, like most healthcare providers, having your data easily accessible to you is _not_ our priority, so you will lose access if you don't seem eager enough and close the page. Of course, being overly eager won't help: you will be forced to reassess your own self-centeredness if you try to track too many symptoms and treat _yourself_.

**Treatment Suggestions:**

Non-personalized treatments designed to worsen your physical, financial, and emotional health (in the short and long term). Luckily, they come with helpful maps to find the nearest service provider! 

**Contact the SUS Team:**

Unfortunately, the SUS team just doesn't care about its users. To minimize our engagement with them, we force users to answer 3 MCAT-level questions correctly to even get a _chance_ to contact us... which might disappoint them. Luckily, if they are disappointed, they're well on the road to becoming a doctor!

## How we built it

Using an existing HTML website template, we learned how to add functionality (forms, quizzes, maps, dynamic scripts and more) in Javascript and HTML over the course of McHacks.

## Challenges we ran into

We pivoted to HTML after some experiments with Flutter that took the greater part of Saturday's hacking period. Given that it was our first time using Javascript, we had to learn on the job to deliver the SUS our users are unaware of and hate.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

For our first time, we're proud of making the website interactive and able to store and react to users symptoms. Also, we find it funny!

## What we learned

Next time, we'll use tools we're familiar with in unfamiliar ways, instead of using something we're completely unfamiliar with. During our planning stage, we'll be more strategic about which tool we pick.

## What's next for Symptoms Understanding System

Additional functionality in the tracker: we want to give not just bad advice, but personalized bad advice based on your symptoms.
