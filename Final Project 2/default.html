				Welcome to COVID-19 Vaccine! We are a small team of researchers (actually a one-person team) dedicated to keep you updated on COVID-19 vaccine research. Vaccine development takes a long time, typically between 10-15 years, but for COVID-19, governments have ordered research to get a vaccine as soon as possible, maybe even before the end of 2020. There has been a lot of debate on whether this vaccine would be safe to use.
				<br><br>
				COVID-19 took the world by storm, and scientists are actively looking for a solution to this pandemic. Even if this vaccine is not available to the public by the time the coronavirus disease ends, having a safe vaccine will prevent this from happening again.
				<br><br>
				On this website, you will find information from credible sources, and links to find for information. All of the information will be presented here will be simplified and easy to understand. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.
