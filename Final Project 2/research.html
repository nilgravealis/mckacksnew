				So far, there has not been a vaccine developed for COVID-19. Vaccine development typically takes around 10-15 years to ensure long-term safety. However, this disease is spreading at an incredibly fast rate, and the government wants a method of prevention as soon as possible. Researchers are doing daily experiments to make a vaccine as soon as possible, but there has been debate on whether this vaccine would be safe to use or not. 
				<br><br><br><br>
				CURRENT STATUS OF VACCINE
				<br><br>
				Even though the vaccine for COVID-19 has not been developed, many scientists are trying some experimental vaccines. Large companies such as Moderna have conducted a lot of research regarding this new vaccine but have yet to find one safe enough for the public. In the vaccine they are developing with the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), they showed neutralizing antibodies in eight people. When Anthony Fauci, the director for NIAID, was questioned about the vaccines, he said that he was not really very concerned about the timetable. In his interview with STAT News, said that they were developing “at risk,” but all together, it will save them months of time. When testing the vaccine at a higher dose, they had some adverse events. There is still not enough data from testing. Even if they come up with a vaccine right now, they still need a few months of vaccinated individuals being exposed. They need to test it to ensure safety before releasing it to the public.
				<br><br><br><br>
				CONTROVERSY
				<br><br>
				Many people believe that this vaccine, even after testing, will not be safe to use. The COVID-19 Vaccine is expected to be available to the public in 12-18 months, and no matter how long, this will not be enough time to test long term effects of the vaccine. Some are questioning whether it will be ethical for the government to release this vaccine without knowing the full effects. This raises the question of is it better to get the vaccine and be protected against COVID-19, but be subject to uncertain long-term effects, or not get the vaccine, and hope that COVID-19 becomes a thing of the past. If there is a safe vaccine that can be accessible to the public, it should be necessary that everyone takes the vaccine, but this is not the case right now.
				<br><br><br><br>
				ETHICS
				<br><br>
				Is it even ethical for the government to release a vaccine that has not been tested enough as an attempt to prevent future COVID-19? Many people believe that the government is putting high expectations on their researchers even though it will not be safe to deliver vaccines after that amount of time. Even though they are trying to solve a large issue of spreading disease, they need to consider whether it is worth it to put this risk on their citizens. It would obviously be best if we could do tests and research for longer than 12-18 months, but the current situation requires there to be a vaccine as soon as possible.
