				<h1>COVID-19</h1>
				<br>
				<h2>LAST UPDATED 05.06.2020</h2>
				<br>
				Everyone has been affected by COVID-19. Whether it be travel restrictions, closed businesses, or being unable to visit friends and family. Economies taken a hit, and we have changed the way our society is currently functioning. This disease is unlike anything we have previously experienced before, and everyone had to adapt to the new changes. On March 11, 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
				<br><br><br><br>
				WHAT IS COVID-19?
				<br><br>
				Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. These viruses cause disease in people and usually present themselves as the common cold. However, the COVID-19 virus had not been previously discovered before, meaning we were not equipped to deal with it. In December 2019, numerous cases of pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, China. This disease quickly spread internationally, devastating countries like Italy, the United States, and the UK. Only essential services remained open during this period and people were advised to stay home and social distance. The most at-risk population includes seniors (aged 65 and over), people with compromised immune systems and those with underlying medical conditions.

				COVID-19 IN CANADA
				<br><br>
				As of June 4, 2020, there are 93,726 cases of COVID-19 in Canada, most present in Quebec. According to Public Health Canada, the risk to Canadians is still considered high. During the higher risk months of March and April, only essential services and workplaces stayed open. Canadians have been practicing social distancing, working from home and those that came back from travel were quarantined for 14 days. Everyone is being conscious and careful during this time to flatten the curve.

				SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT
				<br><br>
				COVID-19 is most commonly spread from person to person through the respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing, personal contact such as shaking hands, and touching something with the virus on it without washing hands after. Do not touch your mouth, nose, or eyes, because the virus enters through these locations. Avoid going out in public places and do not gather in large groups of people. Some of the symptoms of COVID-19 include cough, fever, difficulty breathing and pneumonia in both lungs. Sever infections can lead to death. It is possible for people that do have this disease to not show symptoms, but this does not mean that you cannot spread it to other people. Visit a healthcare professional immediately if you believe you have COVID-19. Most people with mild cases of coronavirus will recover on their own. Keep in touch with your healthcare provider. Even if you have the flu vaccine, it will not protect you against the coronavirus. A vaccine to prevent this disease has not yet been developed. It is also important to maintain good mental health during this time, since your mental and physical wellbeing are equally as important. Ask for help if you need support.
